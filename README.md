The topic that I have automated in my program is the calculus topic of Rates of Change. In calculus, Rates of Change is very important because an instantaneous rate of change is solved through finding a derivative. In physics, Rates of Change is a big topic because it develops a visual relationship between Position, Velocity, and Acceleration. In my program, Rates of Change combines both calculus and physics to solve for a value of position, displacement, speed, instantaneous velocity, average velocity, instantaneous acceleration, and average acceleration.
